# Suggestions for co-working

Based on past hackathons of ours and recommendations we found online, we compiled a list of suggestions:

* Have fun, and enjoy exchange with your new colleagues
* Write readable code ([here is a nice 10 minute guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-junior-developers-guide-to-writing-super-clean-and-readable-code-cd2568e08aae/))
* Either camelCase or under_scores, not both
* Ensure that everyone in your group can participate, and has their voice heard
* If multiple team mates together work on one specific challenge, code on one computer and use zoom to share screen among team members
* [ChatGPT](http://chat.openai.com/) is surprisingly good at converting programming languages (**IMPORTANT: Do not upload data**)
* Be mindful of resources
  * **Best**: To develop quickly, use subsampled data with low memory footprint, when possible.
  * We have reserved the strongest GPU nodes of Northwestern, but even their maximal memory (180GB) is limited.
  * Write to disk when having large intermediate files, and avoid having multiple large variables in memory.
