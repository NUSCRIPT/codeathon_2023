# Authorship Guideline

The authorship guideline is based on a guideline from Malte Luecken, who used this for prior hackathons leading to publications. It is slighlty modified to accomodate the multiple consortia and working groups involved in the preparation of the codeathon.

Notably, manuscripts resulting from the codeathon should be quick and not distract from day-job. Further, exceptions from below guideline can be granted in exceptional cases.

* First: Leader of team during codeathon has priority, main contributor to writing after codeathon
* Co-second: Contributed beyond in-person
* Named author: contributors during in-person only; contributors of unpublished data; PIs and up to 3-4 lab members that generated data; codeathon oganizers; PIs of first and co-second
* "Clinical and Single-Cell Transcriptomics for Pneumonia Codeathon": All participants will be listed outside of authorship byline
* "Clinical Modeling Working group NIAID":  All participants will be listed outside of authorship byline
* Co-last:  faculty members organizing codeathon; "SCRIPT" (members will be listed outside of authorship byline)
* Last: Faculty guiding the writing of the manuscript

Last authorship positions (and thus faculty guiding the writing of the manuscript) will be formally confirmed after in-person part by steering committee with representatives of sponsoring organizations.
